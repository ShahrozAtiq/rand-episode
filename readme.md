This Python script chooses a random episode  from a specified directory of a show and plays it using the `pyglet` library. It is useful for playing random videos as a way of discovering new content or for entertainment purposes.

You also need to specify the path to the directory containing the video files you want to play. You can do this by setting the `path` variable in the script to the appropriate directory.

## Usage

The script will choose a random video file from the specified directory, load it into a `pyglet` media source, create a window to play the video in, and start playing the video. The program will run until the user closes the window.

Note that the script assumes that the video files in the specified directory are in the MP4 format. If you have video files in a different format, you may need to modify the script accordingly.
